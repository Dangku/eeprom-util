= Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on http://keepachangelog.com/[Keep a Changelog]
and this project adheres to http://semver.org/[Semantic Versioning]
since version v3.0.0.

== <<v3.0.1>> - 2018-03-20

=== Fixed
* Sometimes, an empty ASCII field was displayed as a series of unknown
  characters instead of being displayed as blank.

== <<v3.0.0>> - 2017-09-19

=== Changed
* Utility now returns proper return values, instead of mostly returning 0. This
  makes it suitable for scripting, since the script can now tell if something
  goes wrong.
* If an EEPROM field that contains string data has no valid data, a field name
  with no data is printed.
* The utility no longer allows partial updates of the EEPROM. If the `write`
  command contains invalid fields, offsets, or bad syntax, no changes will be
  made to the EEPROM contents. Previously, the utility would update what it
  can, and display a warning for what it couldn't update.
* i2c bus and address values are now limited to 0-256. Any value outside of
  these boundries will cause an error.
* Errors are now only printed to stderr.
* User now notified with a helpful message if there are no usable interfaces
  for the utility to work with.

=== Added
* Support for EEPROM layout version 4.
* New special layout arguments:
** `raw` layout which produces a formatted hex dump.
** `auto` layout. It has the same effect as not specifying any layout
  value, and is included to improve scriptability.
* `clear` command for clearing all EEPROM contents.
* `write bytes` can now be told to fill a range of addresses with a specific
  value.
* `list` command now also works with the EEPROM driver. It produces a listing
  of i2c buses and addresses of only EEPROM devices.

=== Deprecated
* Layout versions should now be given as simple numbers. The old v<num>
  (v1, v2, etc.) syntax still works for now. "legacy" layout name is still
  "legacy".

== <<v2.1>> - 2015-04-16
=== Changed
* Serial number display/update format (no spaces between bytes)

=== Fixed
* `write` command caused serial number to be stored with incorrect byte order.

== <<v2.0>> - 2014-11-03
=== Changed
* This is a major refactor/redesign of the application. One of the goals for
  the new design was to make it easy for users to port the utility to a
  non-unix-like system.
* New user interface. Changes include:
** User no longer need to choose between i2c and driver I/O. The utility will
   try i2c first, and fallback to driver if needed.
** Now all invocations require an i2c bus number and device address, and the
   syntax for specifying this information has changed.
** Better format for by-byte changes (offset,byte tuples now separated from
   one another)
** WYSIWYG field updates. The data format that is displayed by the `read`
   command is also the format for writing new data to the field.For example,
   the following are valid field update arguments:

   MAC address field=01:02:03:04:05:06
   Date field=01/Jan/2010

* Utility banner is now only printed by help and version commands, not on each
  invocation of utility.

=== Removed
* Commands no longer echoed back to the user.
* `examples` command.

=== Added
* Support for v3 EEPROM layout.
* Manual layout selection.
* File input for `write` command.
* `list` function can be limited to scanning only one bus.

== <<v1.2>> - 2013-01-07
=== Fixed
* Each I/O operation now properly resets the EEPROM reading pointer.
* ASCII fields are always null terminated.

== <<v1.1>> - 2012-09-09
=== Fixed
* Segfault when displaying date fields with invalid month value.

== v1.0 - 2012-06-08
=== Added
* Display EEPROM contents with layout information and data formatted in human
  readable format.
* Update EEPROM contents by specifying offset,byte pairs, or fieldname=data
  strings.
* List bus number and address of i2c accessible devices.
* Works with both /dev/i2c interface, and with EEPROM driver.
