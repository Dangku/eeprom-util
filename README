CompuLab EEPROM utility source code repository.
The utility supports read/write operations from/to an EEPROM either
via the I2C or the Linux EEPROM driver (at24).

To build the utility you can type one of the following:
make
	Only read functionality will be supported, system default linking type.
make write
	Enable the write capabilities, default system linking type.
make static
	Only read functionality, force static linking of libraries.
make write_static
	Enable the write capabilities, force static linking of libraries.

To extend the EEPROM layouts for your needs it should be enough to do the following:
layout.c:
* Create or extend an existing layout. Note that if your layout does not retain
backward compatibility with CompuLab layouts, some features may not work correctly.
* Update detect_layout() function to properly detect your layout.
* Update new_layout() function to choose your layout.

layout.h:
Add your layout to enum layout_names

You can also override the following defines in eeprom.h to reflect your setup:
Redefine EEPROM_SIZE, EEPROM_PAGE_SIZE, DEFAULT_DRIVER_PATH, DEFAULT_I2C_PATH,
and DEFAULT_I2C_ADDR if needed
